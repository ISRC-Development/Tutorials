## *Branches (GitHub)*
* A "Branch" is a parallel repository that is based on the main branch but contains changes that differ.
* You will need to create a new branch in GitHub desktop before committing new code to the Organization. Name it something unique/descriptive!

## *Commits (GitHub)*
* A "Commit" is essentially the act/instance of new code being added to a branch of a repository.
* Commits can be tracked, audited and ultimately reversed if need be.
* Note: Whether you're a seasoned developer or a total newbie, making your first commit to a new organization or team or especially your first commit in general, can be very nerveracking but just know, we are able to completely reverse any mistakes we make along the way and they will happen, things will break..you will break them..it's all part of the learning process!

## *Pull-Requests (GitHub)*
* A "Pull-Request" is the act/instance of asking a teamleader to merge your branch with the main branch.
* This action is also tracked and can be denied/approved/deleted.
