i) Editing & creating a new branch
* Let's say you need to edit a file in Laguna, located at `Laguna.UMB_Colombia/config/settings.sqf`.
* Clone Laguna to your Mpmissions.
* Go into VSC and opening the folder, `Laguna.UMB_Colombia`.
* You should see all changed files showing green in the source control panel (left-hand side, opened with the triangle icon).
* Make your edits to the file then open up Github Desktop.
* Navigate to the top-middle bar that says "Main Branch", click it and select "New Branch".
* Name your branch somethig short and unique then select "Publish Branch".
* Now your branch is live!
* Now in the middle of GitHub Desktop, you should see the option to create a pull-request, click it.
* Publish the pull-request then get ahold of a teamleader for a code-review.
* That's it!

ii) Committing to your new branch
* This is easy.. if you have already published a new branch and would like to add more code to it, simply open Github Desktop and push the commit!
