- # Mission Folders & And Git Environment 

__What is a mission folder?__

* A "Mission folder" is a folder that is generated by Eden Editor when a new project is created.

* This folder houses all of the code and assets for our missions plus some general parameters and data from the editor.

* There are two different types of mission folders, `mpmissions` and `missions`.

* We'll only be working with `mpmissions`, which stands for Multiplayer Missions.

* Mpmission folders are typically located at `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\YOUR_ARMA_USER\mpmissions\`.

* Initially, there will only be a single file called `mission.sqm` located in the folder. 

* This is because we haven't added any scripts to our mission yet.

* Mission Folders are named strictly for functionality and can only be in the format as follows: `My Mission Name.MyMapName`.

### How to seamlessly import a Mpmission folder into Eden Editor from GitHub:

* Open up GitHub desktop

* [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), when prompted, select the following location to intstall the files: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\YOUR_ARMA_USER\mpmissions\`.

Great, now ensure that you have the correct modlist running then open Arma and open the scenario, ensuring that it appears under the "Multiplayer" missions.

That's it!
