## Editing a mission & pushing Commits

> Now that we've gotten familiar with VSC, we can make some edits, but first... back to GitHub desktop!

## *Branches (GitHub)*
* A "Branch" is a parallel repository that is based on the main branch but contains changes that differ.
* You will need to create a new branch in GitHub desktop before committing new code to the Organization. Name it something unique/descriptive!

## *Commits (GitHub)*
* A "Commit" is essentially the act/instance of new code being added to a branch of a repository.
* Commits can be tracked, audited and ultimately reversed if need be.
* Note: Whether you're a seasoned developer or a total newbie, making your first commit to a new organization or team or especially your first commit in general, can be very nerveracking but just know, we are able to completely reverse any mistakes we make along the way and they will happen, things will break..you will break them..it's all part of the learning process!

## *Pull-Requests (GitHub)*
* A "Pull-Request" is the act/instance of asking a teamleader to merge your branch with the main branch.
* This action is also tracked and can be denied/approved/deleted.

i) Editing & creating a new branch
* Let's say you need to edit a file in Laguna, located at `Laguna.UMB_Colombia/config/settings.sqf`.
* Clone Laguna to your Mpmissions.
* Go into VSC and opening the folder, `Laguna.UMB_Colombia`.
* You should see all changed files showing green in the source control panel (left-hand side, opened with the triangle icon).
* Make your edits to the file then open up Github Desktop.
* Navigate to the top-middle bar that says "Main Branch", click it and select "New Branch".
* Name your branch somethig short and unique then select "Publish Branch".
* Now your branch is live!
* Now in the middle of GitHub Desktop, you should see the option to create a pull-request, click it.
* Publish the pull-request then get ahold of a teamleader for a code-review.
* That's it!

ii) Committing to your new branch
* This is easy.. if you have already published a new branch and would like to add more code to it, simply open Github Desktop and push the commit!
