## How does GitHub/GitHub desktop work?
It's really not too hard, but if you have any questions then feel free to reach out to me,
otherwise, [have a read](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!

## Where do the two meet? Why are we using this system?

* ["Git" framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is the backbone of source control and coding-project management and GitHub.com is our choice provider of Git cloud services. 
By utilizing GitHub Desktop, we can all make changes to the same project while simultaneously merging our changes together on the "Main Branch", with the click of a button.
* We'll get into "Branches" soon enough but for now just remember that the central code on Github that is pipelined to the Arma server will be referred to as the "Main Branch".  
* When you make changes to the code on your PC, you can optionally and selectively update these changes to GitHub.
* You will also be warned if your changes conflict with someone else's work before both of you have uploaded.
